## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

In logistics and delivery services, finding the shortest possible route for multiple stops is computationally challenging. For **n locations**, there are **(n-1)!/2** possible routes. This grows exponentially:

- **10 locations** â†’ 181,440 possible routes
- **15 locations** â†’ 87 billion possible routes  
- **20 locations** â†’ 60 quadrillion possible routes

A brute-force approach becomes **computationally impossible** for real-world applications with more than 15-20 locations.

## âš¡ Solution Approach

### Data Structures Used
- **Graph Theory**: Model locations as vertices and roads as edges
- **Adjacency Matrix**: Efficiently store distances between all location pairs
- **Hash Sets**: Track visited/unvisited locations in O(1) time

### Algorithms Implemented
- **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**: Greedy approach for TSP
- **Euclidean Distance Calculation**: Realistic distance measurement
- **Path Optimization**: Minimize total travel distance

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²) - Quadratic time
- **Space Complexity**: O(nÂ²) - For distance matrix
- **Efficiency Gain**: Millions of times faster than brute-force for n>15
