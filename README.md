## üéØ Problem Statement

In logistics and delivery services, finding the shortest possible route for multiple stops is computationally challenging. For **n locations**, there are **(n-1)!/2** possible routes. This grows exponentially:

- **10 locations** ‚Üí 181,440 possible routes
- **15 locations** ‚Üí 87 billion possible routes  
- **20 locations** ‚Üí 60 quadrillion possible routes

A brute-force approach becomes **computationally impossible** for real-world applications with more than 15-20 locations.

## ‚ö° Solution Approach

### Data Structures Used
- **Graph Theory**: Model locations as vertices and roads as edges
- **Adjacency Matrix**: Efficiently store distances between all location pairs
- **Hash Sets**: Track visited/unvisited locations in O(1) time

### Algorithms Implemented
- **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**: Greedy approach for TSP
- **Euclidean Distance Calculation**: Realistic distance measurement
- **Path Optimization**: Minimize total travel distance

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤) - Quadratic time
- **Space Complexity**: O(n¬≤) - For distance matrix
- **Efficiency Gain**: Millions of times faster than brute-force for n>15

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **Efficient Route Calculation** - Handles 15+ locations in milliseconds
- ‚úÖ **Custom Location Input** - Support for user-defined coordinates
- ‚úÖ **Interactive Console Interface** - User-friendly menu system
- ‚úÖ **Efficiency Visualization** - Compares with brute-force approach
- ‚úÖ **Object-Oriented Design** - Clean, maintainable code structure
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation** - Easy to understand and extend

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/delivery-route-optimizer.git
   cd delivery-route-optimizer

## üíª Usage
**Quick Start with Sample Data:**
git bash-
python route_optimizer.py
-Choose option 1 for sample locations
Custom Location Input:
python route_optimizer.py
-Choose option 2 and enter your locations


# Step-by-Step Guide:
# Run the application:
cmd prompt or git bash-
**"python route_optimizer.py"**

Choose input method:
- Option 1: Use pre-defined sample locations (10 locations)
- Option 2: Enter custom locations manually

For custom locations:
- Start with Warehouse (0, 0) - automatically added
- Enter each delivery location with name and coordinates
- Type done when finished adding locations

View optimized route:
- The program calculates and displays the most efficient route
- Shows total distance traveled
- Provides efficiency comparison metrics

## Example Custom Input-
 - Enter name for location 1: Customer A
   - X coordinate for Customer A: 5
   - Y coordinate for Customer A: 3
- Enter name for location 2: Customer B
  - X coordinate for Customer B: 8
  - Y coordinate for Customer B: 7
- Enter name for location 3: done

## üìä Example Output 
          OPTIMIZED DELIVERY ROUTE
==================================================
Start -> Warehouse (Warehouse)
Stop  1 -> Mall
Stop  2 -> Restaurant
Stop  3 -> Office A
...
End   -> Warehouse (Back to Warehouse)
==================================================
Total Distance: 38.45 units
==================================================

# üí° EFFICIENCY METRICS:
  - Number of locations: 10
  - Operations performed by our algorithm: ~100
  - Operations for brute force (theoretical): 362,880
  - Our algorithm is 3,629 times faster than brute force!

## ‚ö° Algorithm Efficiency
Performance Comparison
- Time Complexity: O(n¬≤) - Quadratic time
- Space Complexity: O(n¬≤) - For distance matrix storage
- Best Case: O(n¬≤) - Consistent performance
- Worst Case: O(n¬≤) - Predictable and reliable

Mathematical Foundation:
- Our Algorithm: f(n) = n¬≤
- Brute Force: f(n) = (n-1)! / 2

- Example for n=15:
  - Our algorithm: 15¬≤ = 225 operations
  - Brute force: 14! / 2 = 43,589,145,600 operations
  - Efficiency gain: 193 million times faster
