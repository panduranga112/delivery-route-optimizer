## Step 1: Brainstorming & Problem Selection
Selected Problem: Delivery Route Optimization for a Single Driver

Real-World Scenario: A food delivery driver or a courier has to deliver 10-15 packages in a city. They need to find the most efficient route that minimizes total distance traveled and time taken.

Why it's a problem: Checking all possible routes (brute force) is computationally impossible for even 15 locations (15! = 1.3 trillion permutations). This is known as the "Traveling Salesperson Problem" (TSP).

Our Solution: We will use a Greedy Algorithm (Nearest Neighbor) to find a good solution very quickly, which is much more efficient than brute force and perfect for real-time applications.

## Step 2: Identified Data Structures & Algorithms
Data Structure: Graph

Vertices (Nodes): Represent delivery locations and the warehouse.

Edges: Represent roads connecting the locations.

Edge Weight: The real distance (or travel time) between two locations.

Implementation: We will use an Adjacency Matrix (a 2D list) for simplicity, as our graph will be fully connected.

Algorithm: Nearest Neighbor (A Greedy Algorithm for TSP)

Concept: Start from a starting point. At each step, visit the nearest unvisited location until all locations are visited. Then return to the start.

Efficiency: Time Complexity of O(n²), where n is the number of locations. This is exponentially faster than the brute-force O(n!) approach.

Why it's efficient: It makes the locally optimal choice at each step, providing a "good enough" solution in a fraction of the time.

## Step 3: Project Documentation (Your Submission)
Create a document (e.g., Project_Plan.pdf) with the following:

1. Project Title: Delivery Route Optimizer using Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

2. Problem Statement:
"In the logistics and delivery industry, finding the shortest possible route for multiple stops is a critical challenge. A naive approach that checks all possible routes becomes computationally infeasible as the number of delivery locations increases. For example, for 15 locations, there are over 1.3 trillion possible routes. This project aims to solve this problem by implementing an efficient greedy algorithm that finds a near-optimal route in quadratic time, making it suitable for real-world applications."

3. Proposed Solution & Efficiency:

We will model the city map as a Graph where locations are nodes and roads are edges with distances as weights.

We will implement the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n²). This is dramatically more efficient than the brute-force O(n!) approach. For 15 locations, our algorithm will perform around 225 operations, compared to 1.3 trillion for brute force.

This "good enough" solution can save delivery companies significant fuel and time.

4. Tools & Technology:

Programming Language: Python (for its simplicity and rich library support)

Libraries: math (for calculating distances), sys (for max integer value)

Version Control: Git & GitHub
