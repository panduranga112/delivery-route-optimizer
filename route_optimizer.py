#     Innovation & Optimization Highlights:
# Object-Oriented Design: The code is structured in a class for reusability and clarity.

# User Interaction: Users can choose between sample data or enter their own custom locations.

# Efficiency Visualization: The program calculates and displays how much faster it is than the brute-force method.

# Clean Output: The route is presented in a clear, easy-to-read format.

# Mathematical Foundation: Uses Euclidean distance for realistic route calculation.
